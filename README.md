# React + JavaScript

This project is meant for using and maintaining my programming skills.
So far it's a very basic website using React and JavaScript.
This is the front-end part of the project, 
back-end can be found: https://github.com/JaakkoP1998/react_express_practice

Working version of the website is running at: https://react-express-practice.onrender.com

Note: I am using Render's free version, so application might take a while to start running. There is also limited time that service can be used for free every month, so application can stop working for the rest of the month if that limit is hit.
